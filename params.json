  "body": "### About\r\n\r\nlibrecore is a distribution of Free/Libre firmware recipes for compiling and generating firmware for devices.\r\nThe intended targets for the firmware include only those which can be run in total freedom by the user.\r\nThis means that librecore firmware is distributed as source code, and does not include __any__ binary blobs. The purpose of this project is to push the limits of software freedom in boot firmware.\r\n\r\nlibrecore is free firmware not unlike coreboot however with a different focus. While we collaborate with coreboot and share mature code to further these goals, our focus is more around maintainability and feature completeness of more libre hardware platforms such as POWER, SPARC, RISC-V and other non-x86 ISA's.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nNot a particularly exhaustive list, the following helped put together this page:\r\n\r\n* @ArthurHeymans\r\n* @zamaudio\r\n* @victoredwardocallaghan\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\nWe welcome all forms of collaboration - social, security, new ports, documentation and otherwise.
